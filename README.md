# Redline-Catalog
A catalog of all source urls and their respective C2 servers, I find that distribute redline through various scams on youtube


# Catalog Structure

Every C2 server I find is stored in the /campaigns folder with the IP being the next folder and the contacted port being the next and in that port directory there is a ``urls.txt`` where I paste all links I find that relate to the specific C2 that was contacted
